# Welcome to the CICE Consortium!  

See https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/About-Us/README.md for basic information about the Consortium.   
The original CICE web site is still available [here](http://oceans11.lanl.gov/trac/CICE/wiki) but is expected to disappear, imminently.

## Organization  and Governance
Documents governing the Consortium and its processes are available from the [About-Us repository](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/About-Us).  Our open-source codes are covered by a standard 3-clause BSD license.  In addition, our [Distribution Policy](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/About-Us/blob/master/DistributionPolicy.pdf) protects intellectual property rights for shared development code before it is released via a public repository.

## Code and documentation repositories   
- https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE   
- https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack  
- https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Test-Results  
- https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE-svn-trunk     

The column physics portion of the code is 'Icepack'. The rest of the CICE model, including infrastructure and the dynamical core but not Icepack, is contained in the CICE repository as 'CICEcore'.   CICE includes Icepack as a git submodule.

Code documentation is included within each code repository, and links to data and additional information can be found on the wiki pages of each repository.

## Testing
Information is available for both [CICE](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE/wiki/Testing-CICE) and [Icepack](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack/wiki/Testing-Icepack).  Results from our test suites are posted in the [Test-Results](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Test-Results) repository.

## Releases  
Release info is available from the primary [CICE](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE/wiki) and [Icepack](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack/wiki) wikis, including lists of important updates to the code since the last numbered release.  Releases prior to CICE v6 are available from the [CICE-svn-trunk](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE-svn-trunk) repository, including [tarballs and release notes](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE-svn-trunk/wiki/Releases).
