# Welcome to the CICE-Consortium!  

*This page is under construction, as is the code, documentation, and testing infrastructure*

See https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/About-Us/README.md for basic information about the Consortium.   

## Organization  and Governance
Documents governing the Consortium and its processes are available from the [About-Us repository](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/About-Us).  Our open-source codes are covered by a standard 3-clause BSD license.  In addition, our [Distribution Policy](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/About-Us/blob/master/DistributionPolicy.pdf) protects intellectual property rights for shared development code before it is released via a public repository.

## Code repositories   
- https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE   
- https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack  
- https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE-svn-trunk     

The column physics portion of the code is 'Icepack'. The rest of the CICE model, including infrastructure and the dynamical core but not Icepack, is contained in the CICE repository as 'CICEcore'.   CICE includes Icepack as a git submodule.

Code documentation is included within each code repository, and links to data and additional information can be found on the wiki pages of each repository.
