## [Three Slides](ftp://ftp.cgd.ucar.edu/archive/Model-Data/CICE/documents/OverviewSlides.pdf) provide an overview of the Consortium's mission, how it functions within the community, and how it is organized.

### 1. Our mission 

Community collaboration has been critical for development of the CICE model.
In late 2016 a core group of CICE developers stood up an interagency and international CICE Consortium to enhance sea ice model development throughout the sea ice community. This consortium formalizes longstanding collaborations and makes our connections with the operational community explicit in our goals of accelerating both scientific development and the transfer of new developments into operational models. Each agency provides in-kind support through FTE contributions to the Consortium.

### 2.  How the Consortium functions within the community

The Consortium is in the blue box. Research and Development occurs outside the Consortium, in the community, and the
Consortium provides a pathway and support for contributions from the community (including Consortium Members themselves)
by coordinating code improvements and confidence testing on which agencies can base decisions for code acceptance in their models. Scientific review is done by community in publicly accessible (released) code, leading to further development.


### 3. Consortium Organization

The organizational chart for the Consortium shows the Executive Oversight Board in tan, Lead and Co-lead Coordinators and the Software Engineer in blue, and the six Teams with Team Leads in green.  Teams are grouped by topics that
agencies/institutions have the most experience with or interest in. Team leads coordinate work to be done by that team and with other teams as needed, while the Lead Coordinator and Software Engineer provide overall guidance and assistance.
