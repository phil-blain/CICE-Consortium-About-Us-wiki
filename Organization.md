##  How the Consortium functions within the community

This diagram (LINK) illustrates how the Consortium will function within the community.
The Consortium is in the blue box. Research and Development occurs outside the Consortium, in the community, and the
Consortium provides a pathway and support for contributions from community (including Consortium Members themselves)
by coordinating code improvements and confidence testing on which agencies can base decisions for code acceptance in their models. Scientific review is done by community in publicly accessible (released) code, leading to further development


## Consortium Organization

An organizational chart (LINK) for the Consortium shows the Executive Oversight Board in tan, Lead and Co-lead Coordinators and the Software Engineer in blue, and the six Teams with Team Leads in green.

The higher-level, colored boxes indicate more of an oversight or coordinating role. Responsibility for the “hands-on” work resides in the white task boxes and includes consulting with contributors, testing changes, reading code, looking for efficiency gains, improving user friendliness, etc. for code changes generated within the Consortium structure (e.g. bug fixes) and for contributed code. The Lead Coordinators and Team Leads should also be involved with the code, both in an advisory role (to make sure the changes don’t break the model for other teams or the rest of the community) and directly (the more eyes, the better).

New code contributions must have already undergone testing (grey box), but coordination with other Teams should already also have occurred during the development process.
