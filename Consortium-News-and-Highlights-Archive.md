We have publicly released Icepack v1.0, the CICE Consortiumâ€™s new sea ice column physics code.  It includes all physical parameterizations from the CICE sea ice model that are limited to single grid-cell columns or Lagrangian elements, independent of the grid and other sea ice model infrastructure.  Many aspects of the physics and biogeochemistry that were previously embedded in CICE version 5 now reside within Icepack, and new features have also been added.  In addition to the column physics modules from CICE, this software package includes a stand-alone driver and automated testing using a comprehensive test suite.
