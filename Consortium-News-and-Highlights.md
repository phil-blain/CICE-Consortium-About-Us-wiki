CICE version 6.0.0 is publicly released along with Icepack version 1.1.0. Icepack contains the column physics within CICE, first released as an independent software package in February 2018. This CICE release also includes many other improvements since version 5.1.2, most notably a new landfast-ice parameterization with tensile strength, and full vertical biogeochemistry with shortwave feedback on sea ice physics. We have also implemented a number of infrastructure improvements for running and testing the model. [More CICE info ...](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE/releases/tag/CICE6.0.0).

The Consortium will host a town hall Friday December 14, 2018 at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in Washington, DC. The Consortium aims to accelerate sea ice model development by providing a pathway and support for community contributions to its sea ice model codes. At this town hall we will discuss recent Consortium activities, provide brief updates on exciting new sea ice code developments, and invite the community to participate in this model development.

We have publicly released Icepack v1.0, the CICE Consortiumâ€™s new sea ice column physics code.  It includes all physical parameterizations from the CICE sea ice model that are limited to single grid-cell columns or Lagrangian elements, independent of the grid and other sea ice model infrastructure.  Many aspects of the physics and biogeochemistry that were previously embedded in CICE version 5 now reside within Icepack, and new features have also been added.  In addition to the column physics modules from CICE, this software package includes a stand-alone driver and automated testing using a comprehensive test suite.
