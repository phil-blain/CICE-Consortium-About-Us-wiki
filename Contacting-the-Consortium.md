## Discussion Board
The community [bulletin board](https://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/forums/cice-consortium-model-development) is the primary contact for the CICE-Consortium and should be used to discuss model development including bugs, diagnostics, and future directions. There are subforums for discussion of particular topics (e.g. repository questions) as well as a general forum. These forums will be monitored by consortium members but are open to the general community. To start or respond to a discussion topic users will need to create an account by clicking the "Login" button at the top of the page and then following the directions under "Create new account."

## Email List
The cice-users mailing list will be used to communicate with the larger CICE community. To subscribe, send an e-mail to listmanager at maillist.lanl.gov with the message "subscribe cice-users". We will need to confirm your request before you are officially added.
